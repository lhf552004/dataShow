This small plugin is for the JOSM editor to visualize the data. The sensordata is a big array of numbers. 
For simplicity you can use a simple 3 x 3 array and simulate this array.
e.g.:
{1,3,2
2,3,1
3,2,1}
1 should be displayed as green rectangle
2 should be displayed as yellow rectangle
3 should be displayed as red rectangle
